                                (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this

                              volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty

                              object. When this field is specified, volume binding
                              will only succeed if the type of the specified object
                              matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner.
                              This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource
                              field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they
                              must have the same value. For backwards compatibility,
                              when namespace isn''t specified in dataSourceRef, both
                              fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to
                              the same value automatically if one of them is empty
                              and the other is non-empty. When namespace is specified
                              in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn''t set to the same
                              value and must be empty. There are three important differences
                              between dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource
                              only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                              objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                              (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                              and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this
