                                (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this

                                are three important differences between dataSource
                                and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows
                                two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this

                                any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim

                                (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this
                                field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate

                                any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim

                                (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this
                                field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate
