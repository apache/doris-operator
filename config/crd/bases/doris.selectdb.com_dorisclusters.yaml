                                and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this

                                and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this

                                of the dataSource field and as such if both fields
                                are non-empty, they must have the same value. For
                                backwards compatibility, when namespace isn''t specified
                                in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef)
                                will be set to the same value automatically if one
                                of them is empty and the other is non-empty. When
                                namespace is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource
                                isn''t set to the same value and must be empty. There
                                are three important differences between dataSource
                                and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows
                                two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this
                                field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate
                                to be enabled. (Alpha) Using the namespace field of

                                which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty
                                API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim
                                object. When this field is specified, volume binding
                                will only succeed if the type of the specified object
                                matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                provisioner. This field will replace the functionality
                                of the dataSource field and as such if both fields
                                are non-empty, they must have the same value. For
                                backwards compatibility, when namespace isn''t specified
                                in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef)
                                will be set to the same value automatically if one
                                of them is empty and the other is non-empty. When
                                namespace is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource
                                isn''t set to the same value and must be empty. There
                                are three important differences between dataSource
                                and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows
                                two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this
